## Zero Beings NFT Collection

The Zero Beings collection is 6,583 NFTs deployed via ERC721 contract on the Ethereum blockchain. These are the collection of family photos of the Zero Beings who crash landed on the earth and are excited to share some cool stuff with everyone. Their story will be shared across the blockchain.

## Warp Crystals NFT Collection

The Zero Beings need to travel through a maze of mysteries to locate all the Warp Crystals. They need to find all the Warp Crystals to stabilize the tear in spacetime and to power their rocket ships. The Warp Crystals are key to getting to the moon!

Once you enter the maze you will only have 100 moves to find two Warp Crystals. You can mint up to 6 Warp Crystals! This means you will have to run through the maze at least 3 times to collect all 6!

> Currently minting site is only available through Zerb gm ☕️
